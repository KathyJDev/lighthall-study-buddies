# Study Buddies

A web application where students can create and join chatrooms based on certain educational topics, and collaborate with others looking to gain knowledge in similar subjects. 
Users are able to tag chatrooms in order for students to search for one that meets their needs and share the chatroom with other friends or classmates.
Users are also able to import files such as study guides, course syllabi, and other helpful materials to share with others in the chatroom.

This project was made as a submission in the Lighthall Software Engineering Super League 1: Level 5.
